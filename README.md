## Water Quality Assessment from Mobile-Captured and Google Earth Images

This repository contains tools and resources for assessing water quality using images captured from mobile devices and satellite data from Google Earth. The project aims to leverage computer vision techniques to analyze water bodies' conditions, detect pollution, and provide insights into environmental health. Contributions are welcome to enhance this novel approach to water quality monitoring and analysis.

**Key Features:**
- Image preprocessing scripts for enhancing water feature detection.
- Machine learning models for classifying water quality indicators from imagery.
- Integration with Google Earth API for accessing satellite imagery.
- Visualization tools for displaying analyzed data and findings.

**Contributing:**
Contributions are encouraged! Whether it's improving image processing algorithms, refining machine learning models, or adding new features, your expertise can make a significant impact on this project's capabilities.
